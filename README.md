# COMP6120-Thu16-A3-D
This project is a simple text-based adventure game developed as part of our COMP6120 assignment. The game involves a player navigating through a maze-like map using keyboard controls to fight enemies, collect items, and ultimately find the exit.

## Quick Start
For detailed instructions on setting up the project, please refer to the "Installation and Setup" section available [here](../wikis/home/Installation-and-setup).

## Game Control
To navigate the player, use the `W`, `A`, `S`, and `D` keys for movement in four directions. The map is composed of various elements, including walls `#`, enemies `E`, treasures `?`, and an exit `@`. 

For further details on gameplay mechanics, please visit the [Gameplay]((../wikis/home/Project-summary#game-play)) section. Additionally, a comprehensive list of implemented features can be found [here](../wikis/home/Project-summary#implemented-features).
